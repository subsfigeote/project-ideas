## What is Sylenth1?
  
Sylenth1 is a virtual analog synthesizer that emulates the sound of classic hardware synths. It has four oscillators, each with up to eight voices, that can generate various waveforms such as saw, pulse, triangle, and noise. It also has two filters, four envelopes, two LFOs, an arpeggiator, a distortion unit, a chorus/flanger unit, a phaser unit, an equalizer unit, a delay unit, and a reverb unit. Sylenth1 is known for its warm and rich sound quality, its low CPU usage, and its intuitive interface.
  
## How to Create Deep House Basses with Sylenth1
  
One of the most important elements of deep house music is the bass. A good deep house bass should be deep, dirty, and pushed. Here are some tips on how to create a deep house bass with Sylenth1:
  
- Start with a saw wave on oscillator A1 and a pulse wave on oscillator A2. Detune them slightly and set the voices to 4 or 8 for a thicker sound.
- Use the filter A to cut off some of the high frequencies and add some resonance. You can also use the drive knob to add some saturation.
- Use envelope A1 to modulate the filter cutoff. Set the attack to zero, the decay to around 500 ms, the sustain to zero, and the release to around 100 ms. This will create a plucky sound that fades out quickly.
- Use LFO 1 to modulate the pitch of both oscillators. Set the rate to around 0.5 Hz and the gain to around 0.5 semitones. This will create a subtle vibrato effect that adds some movement.
- Use the distortion unit to add some grit and warmth. You can choose from various types of distortion such as overdrive, foldback, clip, or bitcrush.
- Use the chorus/flanger unit to add some stereo width and depth. You can adjust the rate, depth, feedback, and delay parameters to your liking.
- Use the EQ unit to boost some of the low frequencies and cut some of the mid frequencies. This will make your bass more prominent and clear in the mix.

## How to Create Deep House Chords with Sylenth1
  
Another essential element of deep house music is the chord. A good deep house chord should be creamy, warm, and smooth. Here are some tips on how to create a deep house chord with Sylenth1:

- Start with a saw wave on oscillator A1 and a square wave on oscillator A2. Detune them slightly and set the voices to 4 or 8 for a fuller sound.
- Use the filter A to cut off some of the high frequencies and add some resonance. You can also use the drive knob to add some saturation.
- Use envelope A1 to modulate the filter cutoff. Set the attack to around 50 ms, the decay to around 500 ms, the sustain to around 50%, and the release to around 200 ms. This will create a smooth sound that fades in and out gently.
- Use LFO 1 to modulate the pan of both oscillators. Set the rate to around 0.5 Hz and the gain to around 50%. This will create a subtle panning effect that adds some stereo width.
- Use oscillator B1 and B2 to add some extra harmonics. You can use different waveforms such as triangle or noise. Set them an octave higher than oscillator A1 and A2 and detune them slightly. 0f148eb4a0
